# PLANK handoff

Read AGENTS.md and the platform build runbook before work. Read the private
notes' README before machine-specific work; deployment information stays outside Git.

## Current state

- Teraguchi Pilot on dxs-flame-06 (2026-09-16): bidirectional UTF-8 clipboard
  sync is operator-qualified. Mac → Flame uses copy on Mac then Ctrl+V in the
  remote session; Flame → Mac uses copy on host then Cmd+V on Mac. Client fixes
  are on Teraguchi root `231ee8d` / Client `3ba987a2` (main-thread pasteboard
  polling, host-offer dedupe, NSPasteboard-backed Ctrl+V). Installed ad-hoc Pilot
  binary SHA256 `c4c26114f99db1185ab7af8c5951a0e3985f2407681f6c07e1ff43c493dc49cf`.
  Upstream handoff to Alan is open on instinctual/plank#2 and sibling PRs; rebase
  waits for Alan's macOS freeze. Do not rebase until he asks.

- Flame UI monitor selection: `plank-display-prepare --flame-ui-origin`
  `{left,right}` is implemented for boot MetaMode/Xinerama order. Host supervisor,
  launch negotiation, and Teraguchi picker work remain open. See
  `docs/development/teraguchi-flame-ui-origin.md`.

- The operator authorized merging the reconnect follow-up into main after
  manually installing Host 1.0.116. Reconnect implementation root `4173138`
  and Client `e8fc0cc0` extend the previously accepted root `d34a110` / Client
  `060e6424`. The separate worktree (directory still named macos-auth-recovery)
  is now the mainline continuation point; preserve unrelated primary-worktree research.
  Host and Client candidates 1.0.116 retain valid setup authorization across readiness retries,
  stop rejected authentication/TLS/permission failures, and gate new requests
  on the configured Ask/Disconnect deadline. Keep Waiting explicitly resumes.
  Mac Host retains authorized topology/display HTTP503 contexts within their
  unchanged original expiry; cancellation/rejection/failed launch still revoke.
  Linux Host is unchanged. See `docs/development/plans/client-reconnect-lifecycle.plan`.
  Local executable deadline/status checks, 14 reconnect source guards and 22
  CI tests and all five root CTest suites pass. Hosted compile/package gates
  now pass; live recovery acceptance remains pending. Host installation was
  operator-reported, not agent-verified; the agent only transferred and checked
  the package signature/notarization/hash. No release was published. Existing
  branch-qualified artifacts remain candidates; mainline packages require a
  fresh build and must not be relabeled.
  Host run 35074146670 at root f34ca0f passed same-token readiness/recovery
  tests but failed the cancellation gate: a deadline could expire before the
  network queue set its cancellation flag. Explicit monotonic deadline checks
  now revoke that context too; no 1.0.115 package was produced. Initial Client
  runs 35074149761 / 35074153250 were cancelled to include two review fixes:
  restart an authentication conversation paused behind Ask (its challenge can
  expire), and discard a transport completing after the deadline rather than
  keeping it hidden behind the unanswered prompt.
  Run 35074552628 passed the corrected cancellation gate but caught an unused
  synthetic-fixture counter; final Host run below includes that test-only fix.
  The primary worktree's `rk3576-client` research branch and uncommitted notes
  remain untouched. Published mainline remains Host 1.0.106, other products
  1.0.105. Do not select an old candidate paragraph as the current source.

- Current test packages are hash-verified under
  `artifacts/packages/candidates/1.0.116-reconnect-lifecycle/`:

  | Product | Source root | Hosted run | SHA256 |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | macOS Host PKG (6,611,153 bytes) | `4173138223c1d0b0a57ddac1977255ee6ea92b6a` | 35074853150 | `e443bc305bf3e03e3386378031d1cb40bce0de803bdba41bf77dfaa3c83a7717` |
  | macOS Client DMG (86,380,741 bytes) | `3a99c4489ddf40e6ab1557f88f012f711f7141bc` | 35074420641 | `92531ccd820e178245f91b532e0f4d208ac01ea2600a0d277176be08ebbac1d7` |
  | Ubuntu Client DEB (15,447,236 bytes) | `3a99c4489ddf40e6ab1557f88f012f711f7141bc` | 35074423798 | `e4873cfe03d8760ab4855c13429bd91bfcc7cddf359b0a799e6ea280382b1657` |

  Both roots use Client `e8fc0cc0c1d73d7cb78c81524fc0ee425c24ff05`;
  Linux Host, Kymux and recursive dependency revisions remain unchanged from
  the accepted work. The catalog records per-package source provenance.
  Mac Host passed seven real-TLS synthetic recovery scenarios (including 32
  repeated readiness requests using one authorization, ready-after-retry,
  cancellation and ownership revocation), 29 display cases, 128 permission-
  denial cleanup cycles, native input/audio/installer gates. Mac Client passed
  18 topology, 21 toolbar and seven desktop-stage/reconnect-policy cases.
  Ubuntu passed its desktop-stage/reconnect guards, exact dependencies, private
  FFmpeg, visible version and no-autostart gates. Both Mac packages passed
  Developer ID/notarization/Gatekeeper and signing-keychain cleanup.
  Next operator test: normal login/logout, temporary outage through Ask timeout,
  Keep Waiting followed by recovery, and Disconnect while paused. Definitive
  authentication/TLS/permission rejection must stop, not resubmit credentials.
  Do not induce production account lockouts for a test.

- Previously accepted Mac Client 1.0.114: root
  `ba91a32413b6d94e611bb48a873746e182209fea`, Client
  `060e6424ee9323f02ce53ce4e00e47427c0b6de8`. Signed hosted run 35071410245
  passed 18 topology/request cases and 21 toolbar-logic cases, dependency and
  version gates, signing, notarization, Gatekeeper, and credential cleanup.
  DMG SHA256 `0a986e97a2932b8e94f49ba95172d65f00df44245e13030a45252c97669d326e`.
  Size 86,349,889 bytes; hash-verified and collected under
  `artifacts/packages/candidates/1.0.114-macos-auth-recovery/macos/`.
  Manually installed and accepted by the operator; not installed by the agent.
  Pair with Host 1.0.113; no Host code/protocol change or Linux package required.
  Full-panel fullscreen correction is operator-accepted.

- Candidate 1.0.113 adds Retina-aware Mac Match Client: current logical desktop
  size AND current compositor backing pixels, for example 1710x1107 points at
  3420x2214 pixels. Display preparation is schema 3 with explicit integer 1x/2x
  scale; matching Host/Client builds are required. Manual modes and Linux
  Client Match Client remain 1x; Linux Host/EDID are unchanged. Mixed-scale
  dual displays fail explicitly. Mac Match Client preserves its measured
  fullscreen mode and uses backing-pixel presentation tiles.
  See `docs/development/plans/macos-retina-match-client.plan`.

- Signed Host 1.0.113 passed hosted run 35067335971 at
  `527cd5236e832396b6ed410fde4d9f00b345cefa`. Gates include 29 synthetic
  display/recovery cases, authenticated TLS schema-3 preparation/negative cases,
  real-QUIC no-media setup/teardown, 128 permission-denied setup cleanup cycles,
  129 non-waking activity checks, 216 native-input checks across eight scenarios,
  existing audio/installer tests and signing/notarization. Collected under
  `artifacts/packages/candidates/1.0.113-macos-auth-recovery/macos/`.
  PKG size 6,611,113; SHA256
  `2d40969bb830ae761f2f5581ed3db0f97404a2b3b440f7bf1ec55f465ed7f496`.
  Operator-installed Host/Client 1.0.113 are now observed in supplied logs;
  the subsequent Client 1.0.114 fullscreen correction is operator-accepted.

- Client 1.0.113 source is `ec17fc4`, Client gitlink
  `eb2d5ac1cc00630bd448b16976a15f93443ee15e`.
  Signed Mac run 35067619279 and Ubuntu run 35067622416 passed. The Mac job
  passed all 18 topology/request tests plus dependency/version/signing/notary
  gates; Ubuntu passed dependency, version, private-FFmpeg and autostart gates.
  Both packages are collected under the same version/platform catalog.
  DMG SHA256 `a260b5d42ae87dc8d70a72dec786b461e0381c2a3d2ea09e5721d96bf7ecd4aa`;
  DEB SHA256 `40ac84f2077f12573345283c8d27e42283f32226e29261c7e124a68f4f27b50a`.
  Earlier Client runs 35067338936/35067341704 were deliberately cancelled before
  producing packages to include the fullscreen/presentation correction.
  Host source is unchanged between those two root revisions. Do not rebuild
  or relabel the already-collected Host just to equalize provenance hashes.
  Local CI policy checks (14), bundle permission tests (seven pass/one Mac-only
  skip), Python syntax and shell/diff checks passed. An unsupported local Qt5
  attempt did not compile; no Qt5 compatibility was added. Required Qt6.10.2
  runner tests, not that attempt, are the Client compile gate.

- Secure-unlock fix is included: nine native lock-screen password rejections
  logged `The user did not become active for authentication. Fail the auth`
  after a five-second wait. Separate account verification succeeded; changing
  Shift/Caps did not help. A temporary `caffeinate -u -t 180` changed
  UserIsActive from 0 to 1 and the operator unlocked normally, with native
  `checkAuth result: 1`. The temporary assertion was explicitly stopped.
  Root `8a60ee3` (1.0.112, signed run 35066026592 passed) now reports only
  authorized real input as local console activity, at most once per second,
  with a ten-second OS timeout and immediate teardown release. No permanent
  power setting, TCC change, password logging or synthetic repeat/cleanup wake.
  The permanent implementation is not yet live-qualified.

- Earlier fixes on this branch: abandoned setup-token replacement/cleanup,
  bounded verifier diagnostics and successful-auth cooldown reset; authenticated
  bootstrap wake and bounded topology-settle wait; dynamic exact Mac display
  dimensions. See the auth/media/display recovery plans and Git history.
  Before the operator's upgrade, Host 1.0.111 real authenticated display preparation
  passed 3024x1964, 3456x2234, 2880x1864 and 5120x2160, then restored 1920x1080.
  These are geometry checks, not full streamed acceptance. Client retry
  lifecycle changes are now in the separate 1.0.116 candidate above.

- Supplied Retina screenshot/logs confirm Match Client negotiates and receives
  3420x2214, but a notched laptop's settled fullscreen drawable is 3420x2146
  (logical 1710x1073 instead of 1710x1107). This explains the top strip and
  aspect-preserving side borders; do not change Host Retina negotiation or
  stretch the stream to conceal the mismatch. The accepted correction keeps
  toolbar controls reachable around the camera housing. Candidate 1.0.114 implements SDL
  borderless desktop fullscreen without modesetting/Spaces and dynamically
  places the toolbar beside the camera housing. Hosted build passed and the
  operator accepted the correction. Mac fullscreen now uses the current desktop rather than a
  separate AppKit Space or an exclusive mode; test minimize and teardown too.
  Raw screenshots/logs remain outside Git.

- Next: operator qualification of the separate reconnect candidate. Broad acceptance
  of 1.0.114 is not a claim that every sleep,
  ownership, manual-mode and secure-unlock scenario was tested. Private deployment
  details and captures remain outside Git.

- Exact-input Mac Client dependency/Qt caching is committed as `8730581`;
  22 local CI tests pass. Hosted cold run 35070457888 passed and saved its
  dependency cache; signed Client 1.0.114 run 35071410245 restored the exact same
  key across the application change and independently verified its patch/receipt.
  Dependency bootstrap fell from 6m32s to 19s, plus 29s cache restore. The cold
  run was unsigned and the warm run signed, so their total job durations are
  not like-for-like benchmarks. Application/Rust compilation and all signing/
  notary gates still run fresh. Never cache application
  builds or signing material; `--clean-bootstrap` bypasses restore/save. This
  CI-only follow-up does not change the application version.

## Release evidence

Latest published Host-only release: [v1.0.106](https://github.com/instinctual/plank/releases/tag/v1.0.106),
mainline source `4b634071d0aa96c5568e90068f5f42b7cd953365`, signed run
35035036281. Catalog `releases/1.0.106/macos/plank-host_1.0.106_arm64.pkg`;
SHA256 `bdb59fb5ddf2df0afb4704920684b83d81c9b8975602e3d643bed5dd1c8d3e49`.
GitHub asset hashes match the local catalog. The other three products retain
1.0.105 below. Feature candidates in Current state do not replace published main.

All four exact-source runs passed:

| Product | GitHub run |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Host RPM | [35018358540](https://github.com/instinctual/plank/actions/runs/35018358540) |
| Linux Client DEB | [35018361548](https://github.com/instinctual/plank/actions/runs/35018361548) |
| Signed macOS Host PKG | [35018364501](https://github.com/instinctual/plank/actions/runs/35018364501) |
| Signed macOS Client DMG | [35018367944](https://github.com/instinctual/plank/actions/runs/35018367944) |

Verified SHA-256 values:

- Host RPM: `7aa4a71077ba22b836738ec53152c966af76555375da1514cc811065f3efb1be`
- Client DEB: `eb4c918e0c5c52fc3d5b0ef0bc16d340a89393971b71c8384f5491be0ec44985`
- Host PKG: `6e99f7509e31a17a097ee56c9f295f267bea5cd5a00dabf09582433646b94f92`
- Client DMG: `e88a62aee26d553d836ed7dbe6266441bf8037fa1623a27c307d4e602ea6fa54`

The collector verified transfers and retained source/gitlinks and sizes.
Local checksum verification passed; GitHub asset digests matched all four
packages, manifest and release checksum file. Published checksums use flat
asset filenames; local catalog checksums use platform subdirectories.
Temporary download/upload staging was removed after verification.

Both Mac packages passed Developer ID signing, notarization, stapling,
Gatekeeper and temporary-keychain cleanup. The Mac Host passed ten synthetic
recovery tests, four real TLS recovery scenarios, eight permission tests and
29 installer checks. Linux Client exact-decoder, private-FFmpeg, dependency,
version, reconnect and no-autostart gates passed. Host RPM manifest and
log-directory gates passed. Linux Host retains BUILD_TESTS=OFF and complete
CUDA architecture coverage. Local CI/version, package-collection, build-path
and bootstrap-input tests passed. These are not hardware acceptance results.

## Accepted fixes

Authenticated macOS topology requests can recover an inactive PLANK-owned
virtual display, with bounded authority/ownership checks and retained real
geometry. No physical mode changes, duplicate displays, TCC mutation or active
stream recovery. See `docs/development/plans/macos-display-recovery.plan`.

Host 1.0.103 had owner-only app directories/resources: ordinary users could see
a prohibited icon or "damaged or incomplete" launch error despite notarization.
Assembly now uses public distribution permissions, independently checked in the
app, staging and final PKG BOM/extraction. Never broaden private keys/state to
repair app access.

The operator accepted candidate 1.0.104-macos-display-recovery; merge commit:
`13e0c3248d223fd63d84919517df092d3e6d41ef`. Candidate source:
`ca36e48123d58cc84104f6fab5df59c35d14f05e`, signed run `35011167754`.
The Host-only mainline 1.0.104 used
`9284c204b6974e322e480442a0b0b91767420d2a`, run `35013030130`.
Those packages remain separately cataloged; 1.0.105 supersedes them.
Broad acceptance does not imply exhaustive sleep/ownership-transition tests.

Linux Host, shared Client and transport dependency revisions are unchanged
from 1.0.103. The corresponding 1.0.105 packages are rebuilds, not renamed files.

## Build and signing policy

Use GitHub-hosted workers for the requested releases, not a local Mac fallback.
All four clean hosted build paths and both signed Mac package paths are
qualified. Local builders have not been retired; hardware test roles remain
separate. Read `docs/development/build/github-builds.md` and the release build
runbook before the next build.

Signing is an explicitly dispatched direct job in `build.yml`, selected with
`signed=true`; ordinary push/PR builds never receive signing credentials.
At the operator's request, `macos-signing` has no reviewers or wait timer.
Custom branch restrictions are `main`, `macos-display-recovery` and the explicit
`macos-media-recovery`, `macos-auth-recovery` and `reconnect-lifecycle` candidates, not a
wildcard. Certificate exports, passwords and notarization credentials remain
environment secrets. Temporary runner keychains are removed on success/failure.

Do not restore the initial reusable-workflow wrapper: it received empty
environment secret values; the direct protected job is qualified. Missing
secrets fail before bootstrap. No per-run human approval is needed.
Exact-input Mac Client dependency caching is qualified as described above;
clean-bootstrap builds remain available to bypass it.

## Maintained inputs (unchanged from 1.0.105 through 1.0.106)

| Maintained input | Package source commit |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Host | `9329784ac41f50cbec0c9d76badfd22227ec5e5f` |
| Shared Client | `c032da3ae0d7e816a7a6f9bb9a51dd489d4d369c` |
| Transport | `912ece5c64787997f978673ca60d313898a3548c` |
| Host common-C | `775943b5ac5e5100a3c2b1b89d9e21151dea4f29` |
| Client common-C | `b9650552f98d97f6e30c9f007115c6246f0809e5` |
| Client mDNS engine | `b7a5a9f225d5e14b39f9fd1f905c4f505cf2ee99` |
| Host build dependencies | `caf0495d5e6baff94f349853d4a59e3779a451a0` |
| Host virtual HID | `93d57db99a5bf4b1a9fbbc7ad1371671725b7e97` |

The local checkout need not initialize every recursive dependency for notes;
builders initialize exact product inputs. Uninitialized local submodules do
not imply missing release dependencies.

## Remaining gates and publication boundaries

Mainline macOS Host 1.0.106 is published, collected and checksum-verified.
Its completed `macos-media-recovery` branch was deleted. The subsequently
accepted `macos-auth-recovery` work is merged; `reconnect-lifecycle` and
unrelated research remain separate.
Volume/mute is operator-validated. Longer app/alert audio, device changes,
sleep/reconnect/topology and login/logout remain follow-up coverage, not
blockers invented beyond the operator's merge approval. Inspect the new audio
reason/overrun/restart logs if it fails.
The initial failure cause is not proven; overflow no longer permanently
disables audio. An offline display that never returns still fails boundedly
rather than forcing settings into WindowServer. Do not interrupt a production
session to install. Acceptance
criteria still apply, including final macOS release revalidation and live
recovery/ownership transitions.

Treat tracked files/messages as public. See `docs/security/private-information.md`
and `docs/security/publication-review.md`. Source audits were bounded, not
proof against unknown/encoded secrets; credential rotation remains the operator's
responsibility. Do not reimport private historical development commits or publish
old 1.0.100/1.0.101 preparation packages: newer build-path fixes do not repair
their metadata retroactively. Never patch signed bytes or relabel packages.

ENet/nanors and inherited transports remain absent from current builds.
Host common-C is header-only; Client common-C is a separate maintained branch.
Preserve attribution without restoring retired code. Private infrastructure,
PLANK2 and historical backups remain independent of the public Host/Client
repository and release. Historical validation detail remains in Git history,
focused documentation and the earlier artifact manifests.
